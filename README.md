Microsoft: Cybersecurity Incident Classification
This is a temporary README for the project. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies cybersecurity incidents as True Positive (TP), Benign Positive (BP), or False Positive (FP) to help SOC analysts quickly prioritize threats.


Data Preprocessing:

Open and run the notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb to load and clean the data.

Model Training:

Open and run the notebooks/model_training.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.

Note
This README is temporary and will be updated with more details as the project progress
